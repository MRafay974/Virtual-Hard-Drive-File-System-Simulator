# Virtual-Hard-Drive-File-System-Simulator
A file system simulator with a Windows Forms GUI, featuring 8MB virtual storage, dynamic block allocation using vectors, file import/export with the Windows file system, and persistent storage using binary serialization.


# Key Achievements

Developed a complete file system simulator implementing core OS concepts including file allocation tables, block-based storage management, and free space tracking with 8MB virtual storage capacity divided into 8,192 data blocks <br> <br>
Built an intuitive Windows Forms GUI enabling users to create, modify, delete, and manage .txt files with real-time visualization of file metadata, storage addresses, and available free space <br> <br>
Implemented advanced memory management using linked-list based block allocation for dynamic file sizes, allowing files to span multiple blocks with efficient space utilization and automatic garbage collection <br> <br>
Created seamless Windows integration with bidirectional file transfer capabilities, enabling users to import files from Windows filesystem and export virtual files back to physical storage <br> <br>
Engineered persistent data storage with binary serialization to maintain file system state across application sessions, ensuring data integrity and system reliability <br> <br>
