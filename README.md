# Virtual-Hard-Drive-File-System-Simulator
A file system simulator with a Windows Forms GUI, featuring 8MB virtual storage, dynamic block allocation using vectors, file import/export with the Windows file system, and persistent storage using binary serialization.


# Key Achievements

Developed a complete file system simulator implementing core OS concepts including file allocation tables, block-based storage management, and free space tracking with 8MB virtual storage capacity divided into 8,192 data blocks
Built an intuitive Windows Forms GUI enabling users to create, modify, delete, and manage .txt files with real-time visualization of file metadata, storage addresses, and available free space
Implemented advanced memory management using linked-list based block allocation for dynamic file sizes, allowing files to span multiple blocks with efficient space utilization and automatic garbage collection
Created seamless Windows integration with bidirectional file transfer capabilities, enabling users to import files from Windows filesystem and export virtual files back to physical storage
Engineered persistent data storage with binary serialization to maintain file system state across application sessions, ensuring data integrity and system reliability
